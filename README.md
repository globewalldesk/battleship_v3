# battleship_v3
The classic battleship game, for the command line in Ruby. A learning project.
Rewriting the version you can see at https://github.com/globewalldesk/battleship
to include a whole bunch of tests and more rich, chewy OOD. Unless I am 
misunderstanding Sandi Metz, which I probably am.

## How to play

`ruby battleship.rb`

Follow the instructions on screen.

### Setup

Make sure Ruby is installed on your system. Run battleship.rb from the command line.

### How to test

`rake test`

The test suite is supplemented with a rake file which allows all tests to be run at the same time.

### Developer notes
I (Larry Sanger) started this as my first "big" project written in Ruby. I learned Perl back in 2002 but never used it professionally. I helped to start many websites and done many technical tasks, but not much actual programming. I've decided that my project management skills would be enhanced by learning actual coding. So I started learning Ruby (in order to learn Rails) in June 2016. I started writing the first version of this program in early Sept. 2016 as a coding exercise. Experienced Ruby devs are strongly encouraged tohelp with refactoring advice and tasklists, although if I've been committing changes lately it would be nice to give a heads up so we can coordinate.
