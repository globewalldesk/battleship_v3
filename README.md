# battleship_v3
The classic battleship game, for the command line in Ruby. A learning project.
Rewriting the version you can see at https://github.com/globewalldesk/battleship
to include a whole bunch of tests and more rich, chewy OOD. Unless I am 
misunderstanding Sandi Metz, which I probably am.

Test suite doesn't currently work because I did a big work push without writing
tests in advance (oops) and lots of returns had to change. But they'll be fixed
in the next push.
