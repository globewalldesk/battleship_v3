The new version of Battleship will be functionally quite similar, although
it will probably have some snazzier functionality (such as automated ship
placement) and a more advanced algorithm for ship placement. The purpose of
the rewrite, however, is to try to practice better OOD. The difficulties with
the original code were (1) the classes were far too big, indicating that I
was missing an abstraction level or something; (2) the methods were far too
long and complicated; (3) I tended to pass too many variables, rather than
relying on features of the objects; (4) my returns were too complicated.
Most importantly, I didn't implement unit tests! While I could simply add
unit tests to my old code, I strongly suspect I will do a better job if I
start over.

One other thing! I tended to get extremely confused by the fact that x and y
were not in the order x, y on board objects. So I should use "let" and "num"
instead of x and y, and make sure I have it in the format "a1" or [let][num]
(or perhaps [a][n]). Hence since the letters come first they'll have to be the
enclosing array, up the left/y axis, and the numbers the inner arrays. I just
won't call it x and y.

I've also been wondering about how to deal with ships. The old method rather
stupidly examined the board in order to generate the objects and also to
determine if the ships had even been hit. I'm thinking, instead, that there is
some much easier way to construct everything. Indeed, instead of constructing
the board object of character objects such as '.', 'x', etc. (which of course
will still have to be the case at some level of abstraction), I can instead
simply have lists of unhit water, misses, and ships, and then construct the
board by overlaying these objects. Then, to see if a ship was hit, instead of
examining the board, I examine the ships. The board is redrawn based on the
state of the water and ships. First populate everything with water; then
swap in the missed water; then swap in the hit and intact ship points.

Indeed, the whole notion of mediating the hits and misses by the "objective
state of the board" vs. the objects themselves is obviously wrongheaded.
The appearance of the board to the player or the computer is important only
for purposes of (a) display and (b) algorithmic calculation.

By this analysis it seems we need the following classes:
Ship (constructed of coords)
Ship > the five ship types
Hits (!)
Misses (!)
Water (constructed automatically by subtracting stuff?)
Board
Board > the player board (for display)
Board > the computer board (for algorithmic fiddling)

Now I'm not sure about that so let's not say that's the final word. Another
thing to examine are the main functions. There are so many. And I don't think I
can just list them; they each require consideration. For example, one of the
first things to do is to determine where the enemy ships are:
  place_enemy_ships
But exactly what objects are being changed in the execution of this method?
If they don't "live" on the board, which they did in the first version, don't
they belong in a new Fleet class? So it seems!
  Fleet

OK, let's not talk about methods. Let's talk about stuff that is done in the
game, which methods map onto. Roughly in order:
1. The enemy ships are placed. (Fleet & Ships & ind. ship types)
2. The player's ships are placed. (Ditto although differently.)
3. The game begins with a toss. (!! A Game class! Of course! This makes it
possible to count the total number of games played, calculate win/loss ratio,
track the stage the game is in, etc.)
4. The player attacks by providing coords. This seems to involve the Game,
the Board, and indirectly all the objects. Perhaps each attack could itself be
a newly-constructed object, and a game might include a list of attacks (as a
chess game does).
5. Ditto the computer.
6. A player/computer can hit the opponent's ships, or miss.
7. The program determines if sunk or not.
8. The program determines if the game has ended or not.

If each class is supposed to have one main responsibility, let's see how that
might work.

======================
board.rb Module

BlankBoard: Creates a new board (setup only).
  # Generates blank board.

BoardContents: Updates the contents of boards.
  # Given a Fleet, writes ships to board.
  # Given Shotlist, writes shots to board.

PublicBoard: Updates the "public" knowledge about a board.
  # Given BoardContents and FleetStatus, generates a board array.

DisplayedBoard: Displays the board to the user.
  # Given a PublicBoard, displays it to the user.

======================
fleet.rb Module

FleetConstructor: Creates ships of the fleet (setup only).
  # Creates the ships of the fleet; this method knows the five ship types.
  # Iterates over fleet, initializing ShipCoords, to get coords.

  NOTE: The plan here is to create an array of references to Ship objects.
  When searching the ships (e.g., for hits), it will simply interate over
  the array.

FleetStatus: Given a fleet, determines fleet status.
  # Determine whether a particular ship in the fleet is sunk or not.
  # Updates count of unfound, hit, and sunken ships.
  # Determine whether a fleet is all sunk or not.

FleetDamage: Determines success of a shot.
  # Given a fleet and a shot, determines whether a shot is a hit or a miss,
    and on which ship.
  # Save info about ship after hit.

Ship: Maintains information about an individual ship.
  # Return hash of ship's coords and whether they are hit/unhit.
  # Given a coord (from FleetStatus), updates its hit-status for the ship.

======================
ship_coords.rb module

  ShipCoords: Places ships of the enemy fleet (setup only). Called from
  within FleetConstructor. Object = a coord set, given info about a ship.
    # Validates locations for ships, given a fleet.

  EnemyShipCoords < ShipCoords: Places ships of the enemy fleet (setup only).
    # Randomly generates orientation and locations for ships.
    # Calls ShipCoords method "validates locations for ships."

  PlayerShipCoords < ShipCoords: Places ships of the player fleet (setup only).
    # Solicits input on location of ships.
    # Initially validates input on location of ships (not nec. for enemy ships).
    # Calls ShipCoords method "validates locations for ships."

======================

Ballistics: Determines best shot at a PublicBoard.
(This is going to have a lot of related classes.)

Shot: A coord representing a missile strike.
  # Given ShotList and coord, determines whether a shot is legal.
  # Passes shots to FleetStatus; receives back hit/miss status.
  # Passes shot infos to Shots.

PlayerShot < Shot
  # Gets coords from player.

ComputerShot < Shot
  # Gets coords from computer.

ShotList: Stores information about Shots.
  # Lists shot coords in order and whether they were hits or misses.
  # Counts number of shots.
  # Returns hit/miss ratio.

======================

Turn: Runs one turn (of either a player or a computer).

Message: Manages player message system.
  # Accepts/compiles messages from all other methods.
  # Posts messages when appropriate, then clears the $message variable.

======================
game_wrapping.rb Module
GameReferee: Determines whose turn it is.
  # Flips coin.
  # Determines who goes first.
  # Toggles turns.

GameList: Stores information about all games played.
  # Saves information about games after they're over.
  # Reports statistics.

GameSetup: Collects and returns startup information about the current game.
  # Generate enemy fleet
  # Generate player fleet

GameDaemon: Starts and stops the game.
  # Starts game.
  # Determines if there is a winner yet.
  # Save game's current state.
  # Responds to requests to quit.
  # Invites player to play another game.


==================

TO DO NEXT:
... (3) do refactoring, which might end up being a massive job, but at the
same time, go back and write a zillion unit tests and get them passing.—

While doing the above, make a list of things to do in order when writing code!
Share with mentors and get feedback. (This might include commenting classes,
writing tests, etc.) Then make SuperMemo questions out of it so you don't
forget. Finish "Coding Rules" and "The Way to Program."

                                  ...At the very least I'm going to take Joe's
advice and add .carrier, .battleship, etc., methods that point to the object.
I'm also curious to see if I find and reduce some redundancy and entanglement.
In some places, I need to be passing arguments and getting returns rather than
hiding everything. I'm fairly sure a great way forward to refactor is to make
the classes much simpler and fiddle with the things that need changing (such
as adding the heading "Player Zone" or "Enemy Zone") outside of the poor
abused (complexified) class. Another thing that needs doing is making the
structs into classes; might as well, that was the original plan after all.

Then comes player placing the ships on the board by hand. This entails doing
get_player_orientation and get_player_coords, and getting that code
consistent with the rest...it might be automatically.

Another thing I'd like to do is to change the automatic ship placement so that
ships are never right next to each other.

After that, back to fleet.rb and initialize the new FleetStatus class. After
that, setup should be done. Of course, the shooting algorithm is the next big
task, but I suspect everything's going to be a lot easier with the new data
structures, i.e., with fleet info all available in one place.
